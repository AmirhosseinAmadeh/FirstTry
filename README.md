We call the house magic if 4 adjacent neighbors are next to it
and Its value is greater than the value of adjacent houses on the left and right 
and its value is less than the value of adjacent houses up and down 
or vice versa
(ie less than the value of adjacent houses on the left and right. And its value is greater than its value Adjacent houses more and less).
